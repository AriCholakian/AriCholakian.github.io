### **My Program:** 

The *[UBC Engineering Physics](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/)* ("ENPH" or "Eng Fizz") program is a multidisciplinary engineering program that offers courses in **mechanical, electrical, and software engineering,** with a strong focus on **fundemental math and physics**. Math and physics classes provide a strong foundation to be able to **solve any engineering problem**, whether in robotics or in aerospace. Beyond the  breadth of topics covered, Engineering Physics allows for specialization through electives and its Capstone program.

### **My Specialization:** 
I have a strong passion for anything that moves: robots, fluids, spacecraft, and everything in between. I believe this makes me a mechanical engineer! To gain expertise in this area, I have taken and will continue taking courses in **thermodynamics, heat transfer, materials, fluid dynamics, control systems, and propulsion.** outside of the topics mentioned above

### **My Industry:**
 I love working on **spacecraft and launch systems**, through any discipline of engineering.
